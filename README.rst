=============
PHP at Thirty
=============

The PHP project is thirty years old this May. 

In these years, the PHP community has had many events. User groups,
conferences, and developer meetings. At these events, a lot of things have
transpired. Many of these are now "lore"â€”most of then funny and harmless, some
of them embarrassing. It would be fun to have a collection of these stories
before we start forgetting them.

This repository has been created to collect the stories from these past years,
to remember the good times, and the bad times. I intend to publish these as a
collection at some point.

You are actively encouraged to submit your own stories through making a pull
request. Ideally they're in the `reStructured Text format
<https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_, but plain
text stories can be submitted too. Stories should go into the ``stories/``
directory, and ideally have a few keywords (hashtags) and keywords as well.
See how I have used that in "Playing Frogger". Please don't have spaces in the
story file names, but instead use CamelCase.

The stories could include the name of the involved participants, but if you
don't want to do that, that is fine too. Ideally the involved community
members agree to be part of the story in this collection. Be nice.

Pull requests with updates to stories, or to add or fix details, are also
welcome.

If you want to submit them anonymously, or not linked to your GitHub account,
feel free to use `this form <https://form.jotform.com/250653852848063>`_, and
I will add them manually.
