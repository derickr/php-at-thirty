WurstCon - The Wurst Story in PHP

Gather around the grill, children, and let me tell you the story of the first WurstCon.

There once was a man named Doug Sohn, and he ran a wonderful restaurant in Chicago called "Hot Dog's." It was an award winning venue that specialized in one thing - hot dogs. You could get almost any animal in hot dog form, from alligators to snake, and more. He also specialized in duck-fat fries. It was a wonderful place.

In 2014 Doug decided that it was time to do something else, and announced that he was going to close the restaurant. A few members of the PHP community decided that they wanted to visit before this historic venue closed, and a plan was formed.

Jeremy Mikola, Daniel Cousineau, Phil Sturgeon, and Matt Frost planned that trip to Chicago. The three New Yorkers, Jeremy, Daniel, and Phil, enlisted the help of Chuck Reeves drive to Chicago and meet Matt. They were out of airline points, so getting someone with an SUV was top priority. Matt would be visiting family in town already, and would meet the group.

A joke was made that they should have their own conference, since most of them had all met at the various PHP conferences throughout the years. It would be a sort of "WurstCon", an obvious joke on both the low bar for such a conference and, most importantly, hot dogs. Word started to get around their friend group, and soon Chris Tankersley was recruited as well since he wasn't that far out of the way. Praise be the US interstate highway.

The four New Yorkers set out, traveling across New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio (stopping to pick up Chris), Indiana, and into Illinois. They arrived in Chicago, and met up with Matt. The group then went to Hot Doug's, and had a wonderful meal. The hot dogs were amazing, the fries were delicious, and the company was great. Harvey Birdman played on the DVD player, keeping the travelers entertained as they drove into the night. Their first destination: The Wieners Circle, another infamous hot dog destination in Chicago.

It was a silly place. Chuck ordered a milk shake. Don't Google it.

They met up with Sammy Powers, another member of the PHP community and a native of Chicago. He opened his home to them, and Phil stole some liqour. I believe Sammy also had a copy of "Everybody Poops," and a bag of apples. The third episode of ["PHP RoundTable"](https://phproundtable.com/) was recorded. Thankfully it has been lost to time.

The group retired to their hostel for the night, dreaming of hot dogs.

The next day they woke up early, and headed on the train to Hot Doug's. They arrived to find that the line was already incredibly long, and after finding the end were grateful to be one of the last sets of people admitted. Hot Doug's regularly had waiting times as long as 8 hours, and the group was blessed to be able to stay in line.

It truely was a magical experience, and a full conference was held in line as they waited. A talk was given by Chris Tankersley on git's shallow clones. A hackathon was performed, including contributions to some major PHP projects. Lunch was sponsored by Chris Hartjes, with catering provided by Dominos. As it turns out, yes, you can get pizza delivered on the side of the street. Dominos then went on to introduce Pinpoint Delivery. I'm not saying the two things are related, just pointing it out.

A mental health summit was held, as well as a job fair. The group was even included in an interview that would eventually show up in the documentary "Hot Doug's," and they are still waiting for their residuals to be paid.

They did lose Phil at some point, but he would show up later.

As the sun set, the group finally made it inside Hot Doug's. It was as amazing as they had dreamed. Everyone left the restaurant with full bellies and great memories.

The next day everyone not living in Chicago left, and the group picked up Phil in the middle of an intersection on the way out.

The trip was a success. After that, it was decided that more WurstCon's would be help, and after each conference they would find an venue to eat at. The community would be invited as well, so that everyone could enjoy the after-conference that is WurstCon.

10 years later, it is still going strong. We've lost track of exactly how many WurstCons there have been, but it's even spawned sub-conferences (reach out to @dragonmantank for franchise opportunites). The latest WurstCon was held in 2025 at PHP Tek in Chicago at Portillo's, attended by around 40 people. While the attendees have changed over time, the joke still lives.

And we hope it never dies.
