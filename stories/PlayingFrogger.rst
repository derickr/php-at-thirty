*Setting:* php[tek], Chicago, various years

*Tags:* #nights-out #conference

The php[tek] conference has been held in Chicago, near O'Hare airport for at
least as early as 2007. In fact, its current current iteration in 2025 is
still there.

The hotel bar is fairly boring, and as it is near the airport, there isn't
really anything around here, unless you're willing to drive.

Luckily, for many years, there used to be a bar across the street called
"Shoeless Joe's". They're no longer there as their lot was going to get
redeveloped into a new part of the airport, but that has never happened, but I
digress.

To have something a something more interesting, many of us would like to go an
actual bar, and that was indeed this Shoeless Joe's. Unfortunately the bar was
located diagonally opposite of a busy road crossing away from the hotel.

As this is the US, there has been no concern on how pedestrians would cross
this road safely. There wasn't even a pedestrian light for a long time.

So instead of doing the sensible thing and walking along while to find the
safe crossing, we all thought it would be great fun to play our chances
crossing the road in between the traffic light's cycles.

This wasn't too hard going *to* the bar, but a whole lot more haphazard
after a few (late) nights out at the bar! Luckily, I am not aware of any
traffic accidents or injuries. At least not from the traffic ;-).
