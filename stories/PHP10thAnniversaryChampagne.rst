Celebrating PHP 10th Anniversary With A Surprise

In spring 2005, PHP 10th birthday was approaching quickly. With a group of the PHP group (sic), we decided to gather and send a present to Rasmus Lerdorf. It was a good opportunity to do something big.

We had some discussions about what could be a good present. Eventually, I suggested a box of champagne, with a twist: a box of millesime 1995. Usually, champagne does not have a millesime (a year of production), but some good 'maisons de champagne' did so.

It was a bit harder to find the 1995 millesime, as they are rare. Yet, it was also the time of the internet, so I managed to find a local wine shop in California, who was very happy to have such a box. 

We discussed various aspects for the champagne and PHP. Of course, the shop used PHP on their site, although, they were not exactly aware of it, nor even what PHP was. That was not the point. 

I made sure the delivery of the gift was programmed for June 8th. The target was early in the evening, so that we could also send a message, or pass a phone call for the closest one. 

After everything was ready, we patiently waited for the moment to come...

On June 8th, the delivery man rang on time at Rasmus' home. Of course, as with anything well planned, he was not home. But his wife was. As she was surprised by the unexpected box, she had to call him to ask: 

- Did you expect a package tonight? 

Obviously, it was a surprise, so the answer was negative. 

- Well, did you order something that is 'for 21 years old and older' ? 

- ... what? 

The context is that California law requires deliveries of alcool to be wrapped to prevent underage minor to see it, so the package was wrapped in ominous warnings. 

The delivery man had to spoil the fact is it alcool, and the package finally went in the house. It was opened and drunk as expect. 

Later, Rasmus told me it was the finest champagne he had ever drunk.

Happy birthday PHP!
